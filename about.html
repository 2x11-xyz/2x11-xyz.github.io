                    Dr. Eli Bressert (Ph.D., Astrophysics) has a passion for
                    harnessing ML/AI to create a brighter, more innovative
                    future. Over the course of his career, spanning leadership
                    roles at Netflix, Apple, Stitch Fix, and Scenset (founded–AI
                    travel startup), he's consistently bridged research and
                    product development to drive high‐impact, user‐centric
                    solutions.

                <p>
                    Fueled by the conviction that reasoning AI is the key to
                    unlocking humanity's next wave of breakthroughs, he founded
                    Algorithmic Productions to merge scientific rigor with
                    innovative algorithmic solutions. We believe in building
                    systems that aren't just powerful, but also transparent,
                    secure, and ultimately transformative, paving the way for
                    accelerated scientific and technological progress.
